I connected the Arduino microcontroller to the computer.                                                           
Then I copied a sketch given in the assigment.                                                                   
Then I uploaded the sketch to the microcontroller.                                                                      
When it finshed compling, I collected data for wave gesture and fistbump gesture.                                       
For the data collection I used Ardu Spreadsheeet, which added to Tools menu.                                                    
I collected 50 samples for each of the gesture.
