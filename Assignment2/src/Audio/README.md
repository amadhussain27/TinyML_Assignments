I downloaded the arduino Nano 33 BLE IMU directory contain Mic.h and arduino -33-audio.ino from the link given in the assignment.
Then I connect my Arduino Nano 33 BLE sence to my computer.                                                                    
Then I uploaed .ino file on Arduino IDE.                                                                                      
Then I spoke the four words, stop, go, up and down the collected the serial monitor data.
For the data collection I added Ardu Spreadsheet to Arduino Tools Menu.
I did not do any additional coding for capturing data.
I collected 25 samples for each of four words.
